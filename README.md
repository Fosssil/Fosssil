### My Vision

I aim to achieve great things in the future with my knowledge and deep understanding of computer science. My interests lie in working on challenging low-level projects like:

- Linux kernel development
- Driver development
- Firmware creation
- Network internals
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
- Compilers
- Databases
- System software

I have a research mindset and love teaching and sharing knowledge. I believe in free education for everyone and aspire to educate and empower those who cannot afford it. I also hold a special place for inspiring quotes:

- "A warrior's path is a solitary one."
- "Ad meliora - Towards better things."
- "Ad meliora et ad maiora semper - always towards better things and towards bigger things."

<h3 align="center">Let's make the world a more rational and scientifically-driven place together!</h3>
<!--
I want to made it more fun looking but at same time appear to be more rational like if some read He things that this man knows his work and will be something in future.
<!--
Although I am a professional devops engineer but let me tell you my vision of my future and what I want. I want to achieve great thing in future with my knowledge and deep understanding of computer and its related fundamentals. I want to work in some low level things which many people afraid to do or find it difficult for them to go that way or they just find it unnecessary like writing encoding systems, Linux kernel development, driver development, making firmware, making network internals, Working on instruction sets, working on IPC ( inter process communication), writing text editors like vim, writing compiler, making databases, making some system software etc. I hope you can understand there are millions of things like this I can't write everything. 
I have a research mindset and I also like philosophy, literature, teaching other peoples sharing knowledge, I literally read books and I can read of any kind of book instead of self-help books because they are bullshit and they give illusion of motivation and I  do want any kind of logical fallacies around me. I am not a professor but I treat myself like I am in their shoes and behave like them. I always dress like a gentlemen like old retired Englishmen professors, like James bond means I am always sharply dressed. I love creating things and understanding them how they work. I love engineering and scientific approach to things. I am also an atheist.Now my nature Is like this that I love to give other people my knowledge , teaching them. Write everything I know and learn in notebooks. I love software and deep computer things as I told you. But I also love humor and modern things like memes and approaching people from them that is why I am making README like this . I am just 23 years old and I don't know where will my life will go what will become of it but I am currently of energy because I can feel everyday is new and when I will wake and learn something new that day. I feel like  I don't need anyone in my life and I am above average from everyone around me. They are just bunch of idiots and cannot see big picture and will always be bound by their mind and their irrational thoughts etc. I why I love teaching people because I want to make them more rational etc. I always follow  "APJ Abdul kalam" I like his work and his thoughts but I quote that changed my life is "If four things are followed - having a great aim, acquiring knowledge, hard work, and perseverance - then anything can be achieved" and I think that it is deeply injected in me. All I want is knowledge and I can do anything for that.  I just want to learn things to their last level to their last point and then teach them. I love books, music, art, movies, literature, science, computers, Linux, open source communities etc. I also love these sentences I can relate with them any they give me energy "A warrior's path is solitary one", "ad meliora - Towards better things", "ad meliora et ad maiora semper- always towards better things and towards bigger things". I don't want to be average like every person. I love how people work together to make this world a better places. But I hate people who are irrational, unscientific. I love education and love concept of free education to everyone so that Everyone can be more scientific and give something to the world. I want to educate poor and orphan children or kids who can't afford education I want to teach them. These all I have told this my life in short obviously I have more to it but I can not able to tell everything because it is so complex that it is difficult for me to write down. But in short this is it. I can add to in future if I need to -->
